My name is Austin Robison
I am a senior general science major
And I am minoring in cs, psy, ethics and math
I hope to get a job in statistical analysis, or risk management
Thus I want to learn C because it should be a useful tool
Hopefully my knowledge in Python and SPSS should get me a job
otherwise programming in other languages is an option   
I am excited to learn more in this class
and develop some good programming habits
luckily Ive done a lot of programming in vim
so this stuff is easier for me than others
I completed CIS 210 all in a linux partition on my chromebook
using vim and bash and it was very challenging
but I feel like the second time around
with the aid of the GE's and professor childs 
it should be easier. I am out of words now
this is a story all about how
my life got flipped, turned upside down
ill tell you how i became the prince of a town
called bel-air
in westphiladelphia born and raidsed
on the playground is where i spent most of my days
chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
and all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
when a couple of guys who were up to no good
started making trouble in my neighborhood
i got in one little fight and my mom said
you are moving in with your auntie and uncle in bel air
I begged and pleaded with her day after day
but she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
she gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
i put my walkman on and said I might as well kick it 
first class yo this is bad 
drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
is this what the people of bel air living like
hmm this might be alright
